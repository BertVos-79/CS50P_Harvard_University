# CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python (Harvard University)

Welcome to my repository containing the coding exercises and the final project I completed for **CS50‚Äôs Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P)** by **Harvard University**. This journey required a lot of time and effort, but I am incredibly proud of what I have learned and accomplished.

## About the Course

**CS50P** is an introductory programming course taught by **David J. Malan** at **Harvard University**. It teaches the fundamentals of Python programming through hands-on problem sets and a final project. The course covers key programming concepts such as functions, loops, conditionals, exceptions, libraries, unit tests, regular expressions, and object-oriented programming.

üìå **Official Course Website:** [CS50P on Harvard‚Äôs OpenCourseWare](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)

This course is suitable for beginners and requires no prior programming experience. It is also part of **HarvardX** on edX, where students can earn a **verified certificate** upon completion.

## Course Structure

The course consists of **10 chapters** (starting from 0, following Python‚Äôs convention):

0. Functions & Variables
1. Conditionals
2. Loops
3. Exceptions
4. Libraries
5. Unit Tests
6. File I/O
7. Regular Expressions
8. Object-Oriented Programming
9. Et Cetera

Each chapter contains a **problem set** with coding exercises that apply the learned concepts.

### **Problem Set 9: Final Project**
The **final project** is the climax of the course. For my project, I built **SlideSift** ‚Äì a Python tool that removes redundant slides from PDFs automatically.

#### **Final Project: SlideSift**
üìå **Project Description:**
- SlideSift analyzes presentation slides exported as PDFs.
- It applies a **rule-based approach** to detect incremental builds.
- It removes redundant slides, keeping only the most complete versions.
- Uses **PyMuPDF and PyPDF2** for PDF processing.
- Comes with a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for easy use.

üìå **Features:**
‚úî GUI for selecting input/output PDFs  
‚úî Automated slide filtering  
‚úî Efficient processing using PyMuPDF & PyPDF2  
‚úî Fully tested with pytest
